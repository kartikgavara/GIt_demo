This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Reading data from TSV file and selecting three countries:

```{r}
df <-read.delim("~/Desktop/iplant_workshop/output/combined_gapMinder.tsv",sep="\t")
new.data<-subset(df,country=="India"|country=="China"|country=="Albania")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("reshape2")

library("ggthemes")
library("plyr")
ggplot(data =new.data , aes(x=year, y=gdpPercap, color=country)) +
  geom_point(size=4)+facet_grid(country~.)
```

There is a dip in GDP of Albania in around 1992-1993 when compared to India and China.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
